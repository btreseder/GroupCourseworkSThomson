MTH2005 Group Project - In this report we analyse and comment on the interactions between the Earth, its atmosphere and the radiation it absorbs and emits. We make use of schemes like forward-Euler, finite difference, and the trapezoidal method in order to code the different conditions into MATLAB. With the aim of creating profiles for upward and downward fluxes, and temperature, we look at increasingly complex conditions. Starting with the assumption of radiative equilibrium, we deepen our understanding by then removing this (quite unrealistic) property and observing how pressure then changes in these circumstances, and consequently how temperature evolves in time. Also included in this report, is the affect of varying latitude and horizontal diffusion in the behaviour of the atmosphere.
